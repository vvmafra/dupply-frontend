# commit

## When to use

Triggered by: "commit", "fazer commit", "commit and push", or invoking the `/commit` skill.

Runs the full workflow: confirm branch → review changes → stage → commit → push.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Confirm branch (mandatory — stop here first)

Run in parallel:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status -sb
```

**Tell the user the current branch and tracking status before doing anything else.**

Example output to the user:

> Branch atual: `feat/seller-duplicata-history` (ahead 2 / behind 0 vs `origin/feat/seller-duplicata-history`)

If there are no changes to commit (clean working tree), stop and tell the user.

If on `main` or `master` with uncommitted work, warn the user and ask whether to proceed before continuing.

### 2. Review changes

Run in parallel:

```bash
git status
git diff
git diff --staged
git log --oneline -10
```

Analyze all changes (staged and unstaged) to determine:
- **type** — what kind of change this is
- **module** — which area is affected
- **message** — concise description in English, imperative mood

Do **not** commit files that likely contain secrets (`.env.local`, credentials, keys). Warn the user and exclude them from staging.

### 3. Stage

```bash
git add .
```

If secrets were detected, stage only safe files instead of `git add .`.

### 4. Commit

Use Conventional Commits with this structure:

```
type(module): short description in English
```

**Types:**

| type | when |
|------|------|
| `feat` | new feature or UI capability |
| `fix` | bug fix |
| `refactor` | code change without behavior change |
| `style` | visual/CSS only, no logic change |
| `docs` | documentation only (specs, skills, rules) |
| `chore` | tooling, deps, config, build |

**Modules** (pick the most specific one):

| module | what it covers |
|--------|---------------|
| `seller` | pages, components, services for the seller persona |
| `analyst` | pages, components for the risk analyst persona |
| `admin` | pages, components for the admin persona |
| `auth` | login, profile selection, AuthContext, token storage |
| `ui` | shadcn components, layout shell, shared UI |
| `services` | service adapters, api-client, mock adapters |
| `domain` | domain types, Zod schemas, business helpers |
| `lib` | routes, formatters, env, utils |
| `arch` | structural changes (new layers, folder reorganization) |
| `chore` | deps, vite config, tsconfig, scripts |

**Examples from this repo:**

```
feat(seller): add duplicata history page with filter by status
fix(auth): restore session correctly after page reload
refactor(services): migrate duplicata service to adapter pattern
feat(analyst): approval wizard dialog step 3 — decision screen
chore(arch): create skills workflow (prd → techspec → tasks → execute)
```

Commit using HEREDOC:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(module): description here

EOF
)"
```

If the commit fails due to a pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a **new** commit — never amend a failed commit.

### 5. Push

```bash
git push
```

If the branch has no upstream, set it:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

If push is rejected (remote has new commits), run `git pull --rebase` and retry push. Do not force-push unless the user explicitly asks.

### 6. Confirm

Run `git status` and tell the user:
- Branch name
- Commit hash and message
- Push result (remote updated or already up to date)

---

## Rules

- Always show the branch to the user in step 1 before staging or committing.
- Message body is optional — use only when the subject line alone is insufficient.
- Write commit messages in **English**, imperative mood ("add", "fix", "remove" — not "added" or "adds").
- Never update git config.
- Never use `--no-verify`, `--force`, or `git commit --amend` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Never commit `.env.local` — it is gitignored and may contain real API URLs or tokens.
- This skill **includes push** — that is intentional when the user invokes it.
